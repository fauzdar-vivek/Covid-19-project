Project Description:
This project emphasizes on the infection of covid-19 throughout the world at different rates along with the respective vaccination drives of various countries to contain the virus infection as maximum as possible. This project helps us understanding the rate of spread of such viruses in differnt countries in different climatic conditions and its effect on people around the globe.  

Data set description: The whole data of covid-19 infection and covid vaccination drives is available for public on United Nations sources. We have analyzed the data of covid-19 infection to check it under various conditions and limitations to draw out the hidden relations between the spreading rate during different seasons in different types of areas. It was extensively found that few countries had the exponential growth of infection while others had the declining rate at significant levels at the same time. This tells us that the virus had different effects in different areas. 

Besides this, we also also analyzed the vaccination drives carried out by various countries in which India was leading among all with a great margin. The insights drawn through analyzing the data sets will be proven highly effective in containing other such diseases on a large scale as we have the steps to carry out in order to prevent it from happening again and procedure to follow in such scenarios to help poor and underprivilaged countries.  

All the queries applied and executed to carry out the filtering and analysis of data are mentioned step-by-step along with the description for each query.
